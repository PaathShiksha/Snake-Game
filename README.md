# Snake-Game
The Snake Game is a classic arcade where players control a snake to eat food while avoiding collisions with walls and its own body. Grow the snake by eating food, earn points, and survive as long as possible. Controls are typically arrow keys. Game ends if the snake crashes. Highly addictive and replayable.
