    <h1>Snake Game Rules</h1>
    <p>In the classic Snake Game, you control a snake that moves around the game board, eating food (usually represented by apples) to grow in length. The game continues until the snake either collides with the game boundaries or itself.</p>
    <h2>How to Play:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake.</li>
      <li>Guide the snake to eat the apples to score points.</li>
      <li>Each apple eaten increases the length of the snake.</li>
      <li>Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body.</li>
      <li>The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.</li>
    </ol>
